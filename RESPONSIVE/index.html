        Wanting something is not enough. You must hunger for it.
        Your motivation must be absolutely compelling in order to overcome the obstacles that will invariably come your way.
      </p>

      <p>Happiness is a ploy. Just a carrot on a stick.., sometimes. Maybe more than others. Maybe happiness is just far away. Like looking on a map, and finding how long it takes to get there. Wondering how much time you should take off. That's really how I'd look at it. Like if I drive faster, I could get to the happiness I've been looking for all my life sooner. Though If I put the car in cruise control, I'll save gas at the same time. I mean that's pretty introvert right? Maybe just economic.</p>

      <p>Maybe just really lonely. Maybe I just want to be alone. Maybe loneliness is the only way to make that happen. Like having two pairs of eyes and just seeing the same thing. Seems like such a late hour. Nothing seems, or feels new anymore. I'd live again, to feel that way once more.</p>

      <p>Loneliness for miles. Down every turn. A dusty road to nowhere. In everything that is given. Loneliness seems to make it's way back into our life's. Deeper into our hearts. I'll never know the meaning of it. The why. Exhausted and much too old to chase it's ever present here and now.</p>

      <p>What I would give to feel whole. What I would give to come alive once more.</p>
